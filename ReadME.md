# UART Verilog Implementation


## Introduction

UART communication is essential for connecting and exchanging data between digital devices in many embedded systems. This repository contains a UART implementation in Verilog, offering a flexible and customizable solution for your communication needs.

1. **UART Transmitter Module (TX):**
   - Design a module that takes parallel data and converts it into a serial format suitable for transmission.
   - Include a clock signal for synchronization and a data input for the information to be transmitted.
   - Implement baud rate generation to determine the data transmission speed.
   - Serialize the data and include start and stop bits as per the UART protocol.
   - Use finite state machines or counters to manage the timing and bit generation.
   - Utilize shift registers to shift out the serial data.

2. **UART Receiver Module (RX):**
   - Design a module to receive serial data and convert it into parallel data.
   - Include a clock signal for synchronization and a data input for the received serial stream.
   - Implement baud rate generation to match the transmission speed of the transmitter.
   - Use finite state machines or counters to synchronize with the start bit.
   - Deserialize the incoming data by recognizing the start and stop bits and shifting the bits into parallel form.
   - Perform error checking and validation, such as checking for framing errors or data integrity.

## Features

- **Full UART Implementation:** This project provides both UART transmitter (TX) and receiver (RX) modules, allowing you to perform bidirectional UART communication.

- **Configurable Parameters:** You can easily configure parameters such as baud rate, data word length, parity, and stop bits to match your specific requirements.

- **Simulation Testbenches:** Included simulation testbenches help you verify the functionality of the UART modules and ensure proper integration into your designs.


2. **Explore the Verilog Modules:**
Navigate to the `src` directory to access the Verilog source files for the UART transmitter and receiver modules.

3. **Configure Parameters:**
Modify the parameters in the Verilog files, such as baud rate and data word length, according to your project requirements.

4. **Integrate into Your Design:**
Include the UART modules in your Verilog project and connect them to your desired components.

## Usage

Refer to the provided documentation and examples within the repository to understand how to use the UART transmitter and receiver modules effectively. Ensure that you set the configuration parameters correctly for your application.
